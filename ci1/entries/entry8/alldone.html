                well... you don't actually get anything and nothing really happens but
                <br><br>
                thank you for organizing the receipts but honestly who really keep receipts nowadays?
                <br><br>
                i realize some stores don't even have a print receipt option for you, it's always sending an email or text receipt and no one really need receipts unless you really really do keep track of what you have bought/done or you bought something that you think oyu might need to return, or maybe you need it as proof.
                <br><br>
                but anyways, hope you had fun trying this chronological filing system, maybe you could use it now for yourself to organize your things!
