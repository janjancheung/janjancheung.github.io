    <h2>
        so i was talking to gabo this week and he mentioned the alignment chart. i think i've seen this before but honestly i don't remember anything about it, so i did a little bit of research and found out that it's actually from the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)" target="_blank">Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)</a>
        <br><br>
        then i did a little more reading/research, one of the articles i read about this alignment chart is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/03/alignment-chart-memes-moral-worldview-fantasy/607561/" target="_blank">A Chart to Explain Your Entire Worldview" by Kaitlyn Tiffany from The Atlantic</a>. this article also has a link that brought me to <a href="https://twitter.com/betteportr/status/1226539849018224643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1226539849018224643%7Ctwgr%5Ee36fffb2abf925811d267c2bd554a37558413c15%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2020%2F03%2Falignment-chart-memes-moral-worldview-fantasy%2F607561%2F" target="_blank">this tweet</a> and that definitely helped me get a better understanding of how this chart works. oh, and there's <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1285174-alignment-charts" target="_blank">this one</a> about how people store their bread.
        <br><br>
        so after reading all these, i wanted to see how my friend/family would fit into this chart (but i left out all the evil parts cause i don't think they fit into that category unless maybe if they're drunk?????????) and here it is.
        <br><br>
