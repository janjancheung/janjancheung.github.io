    <h1>let's talk a little more about the workout routine</h1>

    <p style="text-align:center">well, this is a pretty nice way for me to document and keep track of the progress. i'm still learning so here we go!<br>since i've only recently started going to the gym (i mostly do muay thai) so below is a some of the research i did before i started cause don't want to injure myself or anything like that.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>should mainly target your chest, but your shoulders and triceps will also come into play</li>
                    <li>lower the dumbbells until you get a good stretch & create a full range motion (press db up until arms are straight > lower db down until arms are at a 90-degree angle, may go slightly lower)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>with your hands in line, your shoulders back, small bend in the knees with you chest drawing up > row your bar up, tuck elbows under, pressing over your head (not locking out your elbows) > bring it back down reversing the same movement</li>

                    <li>be sure to extend fully (position the weights at shoulders with palms facing forward > press db up until arms are straight > lower db down until they are at a 90-degree angle)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>targets shoulder muscle, but rather than isolating the anterior or posterior deltoids, they specifically isolate the later deltoids</li>
                    <li>going lighter and higher in repetitions is recommended</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>keep your back straight throughout the entire movement and avoid jerking the bar upwards (should be a single smooth motion)</li>
                    <li>a shoulder-width overhand grip will work your upper back, whereas a narrower and underhand grip will focus the tension into your biceps and lats</li>

                    <li>pull the bar until it touches your abs and extend until your arms are nearly locked out (because the target muscle is the back, which can be fully stretched before your arms are extended)</li>

                    <li>push slightly up on the bar while extending your upper back by thinking about driving your chest up > initiate the descent by thinking about sitting straight down</li>
