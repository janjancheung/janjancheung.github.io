                    Brief: <br>
                    Merriam-Webster defines home as “one’s place of residence.” It can also mean a social unit, a familiar or usual setting, a place of origin, or one’s own country. <br><br>
                    Each piece of content must have its own distinct identity, but must visually relate to one another. Typography, advanced grid systems, images, and/or illustrations will be utilized. Ultimately, each distinct element of the publication will be interwoven together to visually reflect the concept of home, past or present. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Purpose: <br>
                    * To explore the notion of multiplicity and complex grid usage in typographic systems. <br>
                    * To explore the relationship between singular vs. multiple forms, character and paragraph styles, hierarchy, and how meaning is sustained and modified through variation. <br>
                    * To learn about print processes and booklet printing.

                Wedding traditions have played a significant role in many cultures for centuries. They serve as a way to celebrate the union of two people and often reflect the cultural values and beliefs of the community. This zine is developed from my interest in Chinese and Thai wedding traditions and cultures. As someone with Chinese and Thai heritage, I have always been fascinated by the symbolism and meaning that each tradition represents. Both of these countries have a rich history of practices that have developed over many years, with each culture having its own unique symbolism and customs.
