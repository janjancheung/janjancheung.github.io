                Any time you see a multiplicity of an object, you begin to notice similarities and contexts in a new way. Seeing multiple of an object allows for this kind of in depth research that observing one object does not. The way the object is documented and organized helps direct the viewer on how the object is meant to be experienced.

                This project investigates the themes of privacy through people-watching. The aim of this project is to gather and organize a collection of data, understand metadata, to tell a story through content curation and order, to experiment with interactions with a collection, and to develop a working relationship of JavaScript objects and data collections.

                The reader will not only be able to read the story “On Beginnings” from <i>Madness, Rack and Honey</i> by Mary Ruefle, but also experience my interpretation of the story.

                The aim of this project is to build a multi-page website that experiments with navigation to convey meaning, and to interpret a story through expressive typography online.

                The aim is to reinterpret external sources of data into narrative experiences, to develop an editorial perspective to content that is not your own, develop a working relationship with external content and code, and to connect and use structured content from an API (Application Programming Interface)
