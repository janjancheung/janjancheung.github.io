        Web Design as Architecture
      </h1>
      <ol class="info">
        <li>
          Websites are places. They provide services and social environments.
          Like architecture, they distribute access and atmospheric context to
          these resources
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites are inherently public. Architecture is by nature a public
          discipline. Both buildings and websites are built realities. They are
          part of the fabric of societies that are now both physical and
          virtual.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites are inhabited. They become part of societies through the
          interactions they enable. They are homes to communities, to thoughts
          and approaches. They may be privately owned and operated, but
          inhabited and used by the public. As buildings, websites are where we
          spend our lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites are local, despite their distributed nature. Websites adhere
          to culturally established patterns, languages and user expectations in
          similar ways architecture does.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites are cultural artifacts. Like buildings, websites foster
          social discourses. They do so by establishing new ways of interaction
          or by asking new aesthetic questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites are constructed. Websites may use new technologies or
          existing technology to new effect. They may employ new ways of
          construction, or cite old ways of construction. Similarly, material
          and construction are defining characteristics of architectural work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites age. As buildings, some get better with age. Some decay.
          Others get renovated or re-purposed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites exist within frameworks. They negotiate contrasting
          requirements. Similarly, architecture deals with zoning and building
          regulations. Smart integration or avoidance of such requirements is a
          source for good and efficient design in both cases
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites are made by individuals, by collectives or by large-scale
          project groups, decisively influencing their aims, design quality and
          building process. Similar differences exist between private
          construction and large-scale urban projects. There is value in each
          scale.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites are prototypical. Referencing Rem Koolhaas, websites are
          editions of one. As architectural projects, they remain experimental
          and non-serial by nature.
        </li>
      </ol>
