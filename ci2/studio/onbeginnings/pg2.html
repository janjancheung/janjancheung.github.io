                    In poetry, the number of 
                    <input type="text" id="beginnings" required> so far exceeds the number of <input type="text" id="endings"> that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is <span class="redtext">finished</span>—one poem is <span class="redtext">abandoned</span>, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an <input type="text" id="ending">, but it is the <input type="text" id="ending"> of a poem without an <input type="text" id="end">.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever <input type="text" id="ended">, that every poem is merely <span class="redtext">abandoned</span>. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations <input type="text" id="begin" required> is in a cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul Valéry also described his perception of <span class="redtext">first lines </span>so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it: the <span class="redtext">opening</span> line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.
