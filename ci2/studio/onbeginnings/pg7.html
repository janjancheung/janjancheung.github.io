            <p>Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence

                 When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “<span class="redtext">That’s a lot of semicolons!</span>” he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a <span class="redtext">semicolon</span>(which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You might say a poem <i>is</i> a <span class="redtext">semicolon</span>, a living <span class="redtext">semicolon</span>, what connects the <span class="redtext">first line</span> to the <span class="redtext">last</span>, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between <span class="redtext">the first and last lines</span> there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, <span class="redtext">the first and last lines</span> of a poem would not speak to each other.
