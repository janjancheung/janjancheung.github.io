                In poetry, the number of 
                <input type="text" class="showblank" id="beginnings" value="beginnings" placeholder="hover"> so far exceeds the number of <input type="text" class="showblank" id="endings" value="endings"> that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is <span class="redtext">finished</span>—one poem is <span class="redtext">abandoned</span>, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an <input type="text" class="showblank" id="ending" value="ending">, but it is the <input type="text" class="showblank" id="ending" value="ending"> of a poem without an <input type="text" class="showblank" id="end" value="end">.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever <input type="text" class="showblank" id="ended" value="ended">, that every poem is merely <span class="redtext">abandoned</span>. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations <input type="text" class="showblank" id="begin" value="begin"> is in a cloud.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul Valéry also described his perception of <span class="redtext">first lines </span>so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it: the <span class="redtext">opening</span> line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.

                    In the <input type="text" id="beginning" required> was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the <input type="text" id="beginning" required> was the Act. that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the <input type="text" id="end" > of a poem than it is to talk about its <input type="text" id="beginning" required>. Because the poem <input type="text" id="ends" > on the page, but it <input type="text" id="begins" required> off the page, it <input type="text" id="begins" required> in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than <span class="redtext">possibility</span>. And poets love <span class="redtext">possibility</span>! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of <span class="redtext">possibility</span>, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its <input type="text" id="beginning" required>; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of <span class="redtext">weird theatrical shit</span>.” the <span class="redtext">weird theatrical shit</span> is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre.
