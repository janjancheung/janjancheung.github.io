                It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the <span class="redtext">feeling of being replete</span>, a <span class="redtext">feeling of satisfaction</span>, and the <span class="redtext">feeling of loss</span>, the sadness of having <span class="redtext">finished</span> the book.

                I have never, in my life, read a poem that <input type="text" class="showblank" id="ended" value="ended"> with the words <span class="redtext" style="font-style: italic;">The End</span>. Why is that, I <span class="redtext">wonder</span>. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words <span class="redtext" style="font-style: italic;">The End</span>. And I realized children very often denote the <input type="text" class="showblank" id="end" value="end"> because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing.

                    Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the <input type="text" id="ending"> will have <span class="redtext">the last word</span> or the <input type="text" id="ending"> will be silent or the <input type="text" id="ending"> will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent.

                    Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We <input type="text" id="begin" required> in admiration and we <input type="text" id="end"> by organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it.

                    I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you are conceding that in the <input type="text" id="beginning" required> was the act, not the word.

                    The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”

                <p>
                    Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.
